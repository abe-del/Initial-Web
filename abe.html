            <p class="addisContent"> The Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba, officially the Metropolitan sui
                iuris Archeparchy of
                Addis Abeba (Latin: Metropolitana sui iuris archieparchia Neanthopolitana)[2] is the metropolitan see of
                the Ethiopian Catholic Church, a sui iuris metropolitan Eastern Catholic Church.
                The cathedral of the see is the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the national
                capital Addis Ababa.[1]
                It has three suffragan eparchies. Also in Ethiopia are nine Latin jurisdictions (Apostolic Vicariates
                and Apostolic Prefectures), which, not being of diocesan rank, are not organized as parts of an
                ecclesiastical province and are instead immediately subject to the Holy See. The Ethiopian Catholic
                Church reports to the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches, while the Latin jurisdictions depend on the
                missionary Dicastery for Evangelization. The Catholics in the Latin jurisdictions are about six times as
                numerous as those in the Ethiopic jurisdictions.[3]
                Unlike some other countries, where jurisdictions of the Latin Church and of one or more Eastern Catholic
                Churches overlap, all ecclesiastical jurisdictions in Ethiopia are geographically distinct and each
                territory has a single hierarch or ordinary. All the hierarchs and ordinaries are members of the
                interritual Episcopal Conference, which until the foundation of the Eritrean Catholic Church in 2015
                also counted the Eritrean hierarchy as members and, from the 1993 declaration of the independence of
                Eritrea until 2015, was called the Episcopal Conference of Ethiopia and Eritrea.[4] The episcopal
                conference is now again named without mention of Eritrea.[5][6]
                The Metropolitan Archeparch of Addis Abeba is Cardinal Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel, who is also
                president of the episcopal conference.

                <p>
                    The baptism of Jesus is a significant event in the New Testament, recorded in the Gospels of
                    Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
                    Jesus' baptism takes place in the Jordan River, a location known for its symbolic significance
                    in Jewish history.
                    John the Baptist,a prophetic figure calling for repentance and the coming of the Messiah, is

                First Holy Communion Ceremony

            <div class="communion">

                <p>
                    First Holy Communion is a significant milestone in the life of a Catholic child.
                    The history of First Holy Communion can be traced back to the Last Supper,
                    a pivotal event in Christianity where Jesus Christ shared bread and wine with his disciples,
                    instructing them to partake in remembrance of him. This act, known as the Eucharist,
                    forms the foundation of the sacrament of Holy Communion within the Catholic tradition.
                    The early Christian community continued this practice, emphasizing the spiritual significance of
                    partaking in the body and blood of Christ.</p>

            </div>

            <p>In Addis Ababa, the
                preparation
                and celebration of First Holy Communion typically involve several steps:<br />
            <ol>
                <li> Preparation Classes: Children and their parents attend classes to learn about the
                    sacrament,
                    its
                    significance, and the responsibilities that come with receiving the Eucharist.</li>
                <li> Reconciliation: Children usually go through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession)
                    before
                    receiving their First Communion.</li>
                <li> Practice Masses: There are often several practice Masses where children can participate and
                    get
                    familiar with the process</li>.
                <li> The Ceremony: The actual First Holy Communion ceremony is a special Mass where the children
                    receive
                    the Eucharist for the first time.</li>
                <li>Celebration: After the ceremony, there is often a celebration or party to mark the occasion.
                    The Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba, along with local parishes, organizes
                    these
                    events and
                    ensures that children and their families are well-prepared and supported throughout the

                including

                and after-school programs. These programs focus on both academic and spiritual development.</li>
            <li> Social Services: Organizations like the Salesians of Don Bosco provide support to at-risk children
                and adolescents. They offer vocational training, informal education, and social recovery programs to

                faith.
                <li />
            <li>Awassa Youth Camps: The Catholic Church runs programs like the Awassa Youth Camps, which provide a

               <h3> Death as the major teachings in Catholic Cathechism</h3><br/>
            </div>
               <p>  Death is often viewed with dread, but according to Catholic teaching, it is not the end of existence. Rather, it is a passage from this world to eternal life. 
                The Catechism states, “Death is the end of man’s earthly pilgrimage, of the time of grace and mercy which God offers him so as to work out his earthly life
                 in keeping with the divine plan, and to decide his ultimate destiny”(CCC 1013).

                  The funeral procedure in the Ethiopian Catholic Church generally follows these steps:
                  <ul>
                    1.	preparation:
                    <ul>The family of the deceased notifies the local priest.</ul>
                    <ul>The body is prepared for burial, often with prayers and rituals.</ul>
                    <ul>A vigil service may be held at the church or home.</ul>
