                    Yohannes Woldegiorgis who later became the first Vicar Apostolic when the Prefecture was elevated.

                    January 29, 2003. The jurisdiction covers an extensive area, and the Vicariate serves the local
                    Catholic population through numerous parishes and missions2.

                in Ethiopia. They typically engage in diplomatic relations, promoting peace and facilitating discussions
                on international and social issues2.

                Liaison Work: It acts as a bridge between the local Catholic Church and the Vatican, coordinating
                activities and ensuring local issues are communicated to the Holy See.

                Consular Services: Similar to other embassies, the nunciature can offer consular services such as visa
                processing, passport services, and helping Holy See citizens in Ethiopia with emergency assistance.

                Promoting Religious Interests: The nunciature works on behalf of the Vatican to support and promote
                Catholic interests, including helping with church administration and supporting local church
                initiatives.
